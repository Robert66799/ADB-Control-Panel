# The "Not My Problem" Policy

### 1. General Expectations
This tool is provided **"as-is."** In the developer world, "as-is" is a technical term meaning: "If this code works, I am a genius; if it destroys your device, I have never seen you before in my life."

### 2. Liability & Digital Chaos
By executing these scripts or commands, you acknowledge that I am **not responsible** for any of the following occurrences, including but not limited to:
* **The Paperweight Protocol:** Your device entering a permanent "Zen Mode" (also known as a brick).
* **The Great Vanishing:** The sudden, unexplained disappearance of your 4,000 cat photos or saved games.
* **Sentient Hardware:** Your phone deciding to start a new life as a non-functional coaster.
* **Bootloader Divorce:** Spontaneous hardware combustion or your bootloader filing for legal separation from the OS.

### 3. The Warranty Clause
By using this tool, you acknowledge that manufacturer warranties are basically just suggestions, and you are choosing to ignore them. If your service provider laughs at you during a repair attempt, please view that as a **personal growth opportunity**.

### 4. Final Warning
**Back up your data.** If you proceed without a backup and things go south, the only person available to listen to your complaints is the nearest brick wall. 

> [!CAUTION]
> **Proceed with caution, or don't. I'm a Disclaimer, not your boss.**
